## We are AlmaLinux

AlmaLinux OS is replacing CentOS as the downstream rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

A healthy community is required for any open source project, and we are working on expanding ours. We will be sharing our infrastructure, event, and other outreach and improvement plans on the [AlmaLinux OS blog](https://almalinux.org/blog) soon!

If you want to contribute to AlmaLinux, there are tons of ways to do so! We need help with everything from [website updates](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux.org) to marketing and event staffing, to infrastructure automation (in Infra team even has a list of things they're [working on in the wiki](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/Infrastructure.html#help-wanted)).
